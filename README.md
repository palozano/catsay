# Another CLI to learn Rust

This is just another CLI app to learn Rust.

## Features

It uses a CLI parser for complex arguments (StructOpt) like adding positional
arguments, binary flags, and options; even with descriptions and default 
values to them. 

It includes CLI features like coloring, reading from a file, and accepting 
standard input and output to STDOUT and STDERR. 

Includes basic integration tests on a command-line programs (just basic smoke
tests). 


## Future work

Replicate `cowsay` features ([Wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay))
